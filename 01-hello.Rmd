# (PART) Spatial Data {-}

# Getting Started {#intro}
 
This chapter gives a quick start to get you going with spatial data
science with R. It is easier to read when understanding R at the
level of, say, [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) [@r4ds].

## A first map

There is a lot to say about spatial data, but let us first create a map.
We can create a simple map by:
```{r first-map, fig.cap="a first map", eval=TRUE, fig=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
system.file("gpkg/nc.gpkg", package="sf") %>%
	read_sf() %>%
	st_transform(32119) %>%
	select(BIR74) %>%
	plot(graticule = TRUE, axes = TRUE)
```
A lot went on, here. We will describe the steps in detail. First, we loaded two R packages:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
```
where `tidyverse` is needed for the tidyverse functions and methods,
and `sf` is needed for the spatial commands and spatial tidyverse
methods. Package `sf` implements simple features, a standardised
way to encode vector data (points, lines, polygons). We will say
more about simple features in chapter \@ref(geometries).  Most
commands in package `sf` start with `st_`, short for spatiotemporal,
a convention it shares with e.g. PostGIS.

The `%>%` (pipe) symbols should be read as _then_: we read
```{r eval=FALSE}
a %>% b() %>% c() %>% d(n = 10)
```
as _with `a` do `b` then `c` then `d`_, and that is just alternative syntax for
```{r eval=FALSE}
d(c(b(a)), n = 10)
```
or 
```{r eval=FALSE}
tmp1 <- b(a)
tmp2 <- c(tmp1)
tmp3 <- d(tmp2, n = 10)
```
To many, the pipe-form is easier to read because execution order
follows reading order (from left to right). Like nested function
calls, it avoids the need to choose names for intermediate results.

For the illustration we picked a data file that comes with `sf`, 
the location of which depends on the operating system used. The
following will give a different output on your computer:
```{r}
(file <- system.file("gpkg/nc.gpkg", package="sf"))
```
Never use `system.file` if you want to read your own data; in that
case, `fname` should be the data source (typically file or path)
name (section \@ref(reading)). (Parens around this expression are
used to have the result not only stored, but also printed.)

Then, we read this file into R using `read_sf`:
```{r}
(file %>% read_sf()  -> nc)
```
which creates a "spatial tibble":
```{r}
class(nc)
```
This object is transformed into a new coordinate reference system (North Carolina State Plane, with EPSG code 32119):
```{r}
(nc %>% st_transform(32119) -> nc.32119)
```
and a single attribute column is selected
```{r}
(nc.32119 %>% select(BIR74) -> nc.32119.bir74)
```
Finally, the result is plotted, with the command:
```{r eval=FALSE}
nc.32119.bir74 %>% plot(graticule = TRUE, axes = TRUE)
```
as shown in figure \@ref(fig:first-map).

Splitting up the steps lets us see what is happening, as errors from 
combined steps can be hard to assign to the right step. Repeating the 
same sequence, but with the wrong argument to `st_transform` gives:
```{r first-mapa, fig.cap="a first map", eval=FALSE, fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
system.file("gpkg/nc.gpkg", package="sf") %>%
	read_sf() %>%
	st_transform(32999) %>%
	select(BIR74) %>%
	plot(graticule = TRUE, axes = TRUE)
```
```{r first-mapb, fig.cap="a first map", eval=TRUE, fig=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
try(system.file("gpkg/nc.gpkg", package="sf") %>%
	read_sf() %>%
	st_transform(32999) %>%
	select(BIR74) %>%
	plot(graticule = TRUE, axes = TRUE))
```
which is informative, but still needs more backtracking to find the cause 
than taking things step-by-step in the first instance. Again, mistyping a 
column name will cause an error:
```{r first-mapc, fig.cap="a first map", eval=FALSE, fig=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
system.file("gpkg/nc.gpkg", package="sf") %>%
	read_sf() %>%
	st_transform(32119) %>%
	select(BIR75) %>%
	plot(graticule = TRUE, axes = TRUE)
```
```{r first-mapd, fig.cap="a first map", eval=TRUE, fig=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
try(system.file("gpkg/nc.gpkg", package="sf") %>%
	read_sf() %>%
	st_transform(32119) %>%
	select(BIR75) %>%
	plot(graticule = TRUE, axes = TRUE))
```
```
#> Error in .f(.x[[i]], ...) : object 'BIR75' not found
```

Where do these commands come from? `library` and `system.file` are base R. We
can ask for help about a particular command by entering e.g.
```{r eval=FALSE}
?library
```
The command `read_sf` is an alternative to the `st_read`, which
returns a spatial tibble instead of a spatial data frame, and will
be discussed in section \@ref(reading).  The `st_transform`
method is used here to convert from the geographic coordinates
(degrees longitude and latitude) into "flat" coordinates, meaning
$x$ and $y$ coordinates in a planar system. It will be discussed
in section \@ref(transform). The `plot` method for `sf` objects
chooses default colors and legends settings; we instructed it to
add a graticule (the grey lines of equal longitude and latitude) and
degree labels along the axes. It is described in chapter \@ref(plot).

As witnessed by the plot, the plot command receives county polygons
as well as `BIR74` values for each polygon. How is it possible
that we `select` _only_ the `BIR74` variable, but still can plot
the polygons? This is because package `sf` provides a `select` method:
```{r}
methods(select)
```
and this method (`select.sf`) makes the geometry (`geom`) sticky:
```{r}
nc %>% select(BIR74) %>% names()
```
In **sp**, `select` methods using `[` were sticky.
We get the "normal" `select` behaviour if we first coerce to a normal tibble:
```{r}
nc %>% as_tibble(validate = TRUE) %>% select(BIR74) %>% names()
```
A ggplot is created when we use `geom_sf`:
```{r firstggplot,fig.cap="first ggplot"}
ggplot() + geom_sf(data = nc.32119) + aes(fill = BIR74) +
    theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "white")) +
    scale_fill_gradientn(colors = sf.colors(20))
```
and a facet plot for a pair of columns in `nc.32119` is obtained by gathering the columns:
```{r firstgather,fig.cap="ggplot with facet maps"}
nc.32119 %>% select(SID74, SID79) %>% gather(VAR, SID, -geom) -> nc2
ggplot() + geom_sf(data = nc2, aes(fill = SID)) + facet_wrap(~VAR, ncol = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 34:36) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = sf.colors(20)) +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "white"))
```
An interactive, leaflet-type map is obtained by
```{r eval=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(mapview))
nc.32119 %>% mapview(zcol = "BIR74", legend = TRUE, col.regions = sf.colors)
```

## Reading and writing {#reading}

Typical R data science tasks start with reading data from an external
source; this may be a file, or a set of files like a "shapefile",
or a database, or a web service. Package `sf` can read from a large
number of different data source types, each having its own driver. 
The following commands show how many vector and raster drivers we have available:
```{r}
st_drivers("vector") %>% nrow() # vector drivers
st_drivers("raster") %>% nrow() # raster drivers
```
(the output you see may differ because of different operating system
and configuration; when the same version of GDAL is in use, the drivers available
in **sf** are the same as in **rgdal**.)

### GDAL

`st_drivers` lists the drivers available to GDAL, the geospatial data
abstraction library. This library can be seen as the Swiss army knive
of spatial data; besides for R it is being used in
Python, QGIS, PostGIS, [and more than 100 other software
projects](https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/SoftwareUsingGdal).
The dependency of `sf` on other R packages and system libraries
is shown in figure \@ref(fig:gdal-fig).

```{r gdal-fig, out.width = '100%', echo=FALSE,fig.cap = "sf and its dependencies; arrows indicate strong dependency, dashed arrows weak dependency"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sf_deps.png")
```

Note that the C/C++ libraries used (GDAL, GEOS, PROJ, liblwgeom,
udunits2) are all developed, maintained and used by data science
communities that are large but different from the R community.  By using
these libraries, we share how we understand what we are doing with
these other communities. Because R (and Python) provide interactive 
interfaces to this software, many R users get closer to these libraries 
than do users of other software based on these libraries. This is not only 
important for resolving problems, but also for reaching consensus on which 
findings are helpful.

GDAL is a "library of libraries" -- in order to read all these data
sources it needs a large number of other libraries. It typically
links to over 100 other libraries. Binary packages distributed by
CRAN contain only statically linked code: CRAN does not want to
make any assumptions about presence of third-party libraries on the
host system. As a consequence, when the `sf` package is installed
in binary form from CRAN, it includes a copy of all the required
external libraries as well as their dependencies, which may amount
to 100 Mb.

### `st_read` or `read_sf`?

The function to read vector data is `st_read`.  Function `read_sf`
is largely the same as `st_read`, but chooses a few tidyverse-style
defaults:

* it is silent by default, where `st_read` gives a short report
* it returns a spatial tibble instead of a spatial data frame
* it sets as default `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`, where `st_read`
listens to the global option `default.stringsAsFactors()` (which is
`TRUE` by default)
* it accepts list-columns as input

In the same fashion, compared to `st_write`, function `write_sf`, 

* is also silent
* overwrites layers (i.e., sets `delete_layer = TRUE`) by default, which `st_write` does not do.

### reading and writing raster data

Raster data can be read with function `read_stars` from package `stars`
```{r}
library(stars)
tif = system.file("tif/L7_ETMs.tif", package = "stars")
(x = tif %>% read_stars())
```
Plotting this object shows the six different spectral bands read, with color breaks based on quantiles of pixel values accross all bands:
```{r}
plot(x)
```
Similarly, we can write raster data in a `stars` object with `write_stars`
```{r}
tif_file = paste0(tempfile(), ".tif")
write_stars(x, tif_file)
```
We can read back the raster metadata (its dimensions and reference system, but not the actual pixel values) by
```{r}
read_stars(tif_file, proxy = TRUE)
```

Raster data analysis and its integration with vector data is explained in detail in chapter \@ref(raster).

### Reading from files, and legacy shapefiles

We saw above that a spatial dataset can be read from a single file by
```{r}
system.file("gpkg/nc.gpkg", package="sf") %>% read_sf() -> nc
```

In some cases, spatial datasets are contained in _multiple_
files, e.g.  in the case of shapefiles. A "shapefile" should be
really understood as a set of files with a common prefix, or even
a directory with several of such sets.

Package `sf` comes with a couple of shapefiles packaged, a directory
listing of the `shape` directory in the packge is obtained by
```{r}
list.files(system.file("shape/", package = "sf"))
```

We can read a single shapefile by
```{r}
system.file("shape/nc.shp", package="sf") %>% read_sf() -> nc
```
and it is important to know that in that case all four files starting
with `nc` are read from this directory.

We can also read the directory with shapefiles by
```{r}
system.file("shape", package="sf") %>% read_sf() -> something
```
but we see some warnings now, indicating that we are reading only the first
layer from a multi-layer dataset (and not `nc.shp`!).
Indeed, this directory contains multiple layers, which can be queried by
```{r}
system.file("shape", package="sf") %>% st_layers()
```
From this list, we could pick one, and use it as the `layer` argument, as
in
```{r}
dataset <- system.file("shape", package="sf")
layer <- "nc"
nc <- read_sf(dataset, layer)
```
which is essentially a convoluted way of what we did before to read
`nc.shp`.

Considering shapefiles in directories as layers in a dataset is
not something that `sf` came up with, but is the way GDAL handles
this.  Although it is a good idea in general to [give up using
shapefiles](http://switchfromshapefile.org/), we cannot always
control the format of the spatial data we get to start with. 


### Reading from a text string
In the special case of a GeoJSON [@geojson] dataset, when the dataset
is contained in a length-one character vector, it can be directly
passed to `read_sf` and read from memory:

```{r}
str <- '{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    { "type": "Feature",
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [102.0, 0.5]
      },
      "properties": {
        "prop0": "value0"
      }
    },
    { "type": "Feature",
      "geometry": {
        "type": "LineString",
        "coordinates": [
          [102.0, 0.0], [103.0, 1.0], [104.0, 0.0], [105.0, 1.0]
        ]
      },
      "properties": {
        "prop0": "value0",
        "prop1": 0.0
      }
    },
    { "type": "Feature",
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [
          [
            [100.0, 0.0], [101.0, 0.0], [101.0, 1.0],
            [100.0, 1.0], [100.0, 0.0]
          ]
        ]
      },
      "properties": {
        "prop0": "value0",
        "prop1": { "this": "that" }
      }
    }
  ]
}'
(sf_obj <- read_sf(str))
```

### Database

Data can be read from a spatial database directly through two paths. The first is to
use the standard database interface of R (DBI), for instance with a SQLITE database:
```{r}
library(RSQLite)
db = system.file("sqlite/meuse.sqlite", package = "sf")
dbcon <- dbConnect(dbDriver("SQLite"), db)
(s = st_read(dbcon, "meuse.sqlite"))[1:3,]
dbDisconnect(dbcon)
```
Another way is to use GDAL database drivers, e.g. by
```{r}
st_read(db)[1:3,]
```
An advantage of the former approach may be that any query can be
passed, allowing for reading only parts of a table into R's memory.

## Exercises

1. Read the shapefile `storms_xyz_feature` from the `shape` directory in the `sf` package
2. Copy this file to another directory on your computer, and read it from there (note: a shapefile consists of more than one file!)
3. How many features does this dataset contain?
4. Plot the dataset, with `axes = TRUE` (hint: before plotting, pipe through `st_zm` to drop Z and M coordinates; more about this in chapter \@ref(geometries)).
5. Before plotting, pipe the dataset through `st_set_crs(4326)`. What is different in the plot obtained?
